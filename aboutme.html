<h3>Short Biography:</h3>

<p>I'm 17 this year and I will be starting the next school year as a senior. 
I was born in China but I immigrated to the U.S. at the age of 2. 
I can speak both English and Chinese. 
I live in a family of four consisting of my parents and a younger sister.</p>

<h3>Likes and Dislikes:</h3>

<p>Likes: My favorite color is yellow and my favorite food is watermelon. 
On my free time I like to watch Youtube videos and listen to music. 
I also love to drink boba and hang out with my friends.</p>
<p>Dislikes: I do not like any types of bugs or insects. 
I don't like to read or run miles. I don't like to eat avocado.</p>

<h3>Fun Fact:</h3>

<p>The only sport that I like to play is badminton. I joined my school's badminton team last year, and it was fun but quite tiring.</p>

  <h3>Reflections:</h3>
  
  <p>The similarities between Scratch and Python are that they both use user input, create output, and have similar functions.
  The differences are that Python requires much more typing and memorization while Scratch has all the functions laid out and you can just choose them.
